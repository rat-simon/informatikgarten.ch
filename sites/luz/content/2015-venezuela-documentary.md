# My documentary on how Venezuela's dictatorship was built

In the context of 2014 protests in Venezuela, I produced this documentary which explains the root of Venezuela's problems. It's fairly academic, but thorough.

## Part 1: How ChÃ¡vez got to power and polarised the country

The film was produced with support from a good friend in Venezuela, an Indiegogo campaign and my family. The main part is on the politics of Venezuela.

## Part 2: How the Venezuelan economy was destroyed

There is also a second series on the **economics** of Venezuela, covering questions like how much PDVSA's oil revenues Hugo ChÃ¡vez spent on the social programmes ("misiones").
